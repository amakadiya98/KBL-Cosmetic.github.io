              The sale of all goods and services by the seller (the “Company”)
              to the purchaser shall be subject to and governed exclusively by
              these terms and conditions of sale (the “Conditions”). The
              Company’s acceptance of any order or other offer by the purchaser
              (whether in writing, by telephone, or otherwise) for any goods or
              services shall be conditioned upon the purchaser’s assent to these
              Conditions. Such assent shall be deemed given upon the earlier of:
              (i) the purchaser’s acceptance of these Conditions pursuant to a
              credit application containing or referencing these Conditions;
              (ii) the purchaser ordering goods or services from the Company
              based on a Company quotation or proposal containing or referencing
              these Conditions; or (iii) five (5) days after the purchaser’s
              receipt of these Conditions as contained or referenced in a
              Company acknowledgment, bill of lading, invoice, or any other
              writing (including, without limitation, electronic
              correspondence), unless, prior to the expiration of such five (5)
              day time period, the purchaser rejects these Conditions in their
              entirety (specifically referencing these Conditions) by delivering
              written notice thereof to the Company. No additional or different
              conditions, whether contained in a purchase order or any other
              communication from the purchaser (whether written or oral and
              whether previously given or later asserted), shall be binding upon
              the Company unless specifically agreed to in writing by an
              executive officer of the Company. The failure of the Company to
              object to any such additional or different conditions shall not be
              a waiver of these Conditions or an acceptance of such additional
              or different conditions. No modification or amendment of, or
              addition to, these Conditions or any order accepted by the Company
              by the purchaser shall be binding unless in writing and signed by
              an executive officer of the Company.

              The purchaser shall not retain or withhold from the Company any
              sum stated on any invoice for any reason whatsoever. The
              purchaser’s payment obligation is in no way contingent upon the
              purchaser’s receipt of payment from any party. Each invoice
              rendered by the Company to the purchaser shall be deemed correct
              and binding upon the purchaser unless the Company shall receive a
              written statement of objection within ten (10) days after such
              invoice is rendered. Interest shall accrue on all amounts
              remaining unpaid after the due date at the lesser of: (i) one and
              one-half percent (11⁄2%) per month, or (ii) the maximum lawful
              rate. If the Company refers an invoice to an attorney or other
              party for collection, the purchaser shall pay on demand all of the
              Company’s expenses of collection including, without limitation,
              reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs including fees and expenses
              of any expert retained by the Company.

              To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company reserves the
              right at any time to suspend credit or to change the payment or
              credit terms provided herein or elsewhere when, in the Company’s
              sole determination, the financial condition or business prospects
              of the purchaser so warrant. In such a case, in addition to any
              other rights herein or by law provided, adequate assurances of the
              purchaser’s ability to perform its obligations to the Company,
              such as a cash payment by the purchaser or satisfactory security
              from the purchaser, may be required by the Company before
              shipment. Without precluding the use of other forms of assurances,
              the Company may accelerate the due date of payment under any
              invoice or order. Failure to pay any invoice in full by its stated
              due date shall automatically cause all other invoices to the
              purchaser to be immediately due and payable irrespective of their
              terms, and the Company may withhold all subsequent deliveries
              until all amounts due the Company by the purchaser have been paid
              in full. Acceptance by the Company of less than full payment shall
              not act as a waiver of any of its rights.

              It is agreed that the term “F.O.B.” is a price term only. All risk
              of loss or damage in transit shall pass to the purchaser upon the
              goods being placed into the possession of a carrier for shipment;
              provided, however, that the purchaser shall have the right to
              inspect the goods upon tender by the Company or the carrier. The
              failure of the purchaser to inspect any particular shipment within
              ten (10) days after tender to the purchaser shall constitute a
              waiver of the purchaser’s rights to inspect that shipment and
              shall constitute an acceptance of such goods. All claims for
              shortages, defects, or other non-conformities in goods delivered
              shall be made in writing by the purchaser to the Company within
              ten (10) days after their tender to the purchaser. Failure to
              notify the Company in writing of any claim within ten (10) days
              after tender to the purchaser shall constitute an irrevocable
              acceptance of the goods and an admission by the purchaser that the
              goods comply fully with all terms, conditions, and specifications
              of the corresponding order.

              If the purchaser rejects any goods tendered, the purchaser shall
              fully specify all claimed defects and other non-conformities in
              the notice of rejection sent to the Company within such ten (10)
              day period. The failure to specify any particular defect or other
              non-conformity shall constitute a waiver by the purchaser of that
              defect or other non-conformity. If the purchaser rejects any
              tender of goods, the purchaser shall reship the goods to the place
              designated by the Company, by express courier, within twenty-four
              (24) hours after receipt of an order to reship from the Company.
